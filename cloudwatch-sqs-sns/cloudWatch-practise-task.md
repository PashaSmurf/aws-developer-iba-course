### Create an Alarm Using a Metric Filter.
- Create an SNS topic.
- Create an email subscription to the topic
- Create a log group and configure the log group to retain logs for 1 year.

all of the HTTP 500-level errors and name it http-5xx-filter. Use these log events to test the pattern you created.
-  Create an alarm using the custom metric filter you just created. Set the metric name to http-5xx-sum.
- Configure the alarm to evaluate every minute and set the total threshold to greater than 5. Then, set the alarm 
threshold to 3 units.
- Publish a message to the topic when the ALARM state is triggered. Set the alarm name to 5xx-alarm.
